# soundscape-explorer_v4
An auditory VR navigator

This was a project me and my two team-mates had done for the interim semester.

We created a cluster of soundscapes organised in two dimentions that you could navigate using an orientation-sensor mounted on a helmet and a button.

Documentation is not my strong suite. Working on it. Sorry.
